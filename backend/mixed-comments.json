    "title": "AITA for refusing to be the \"family driver\" now that I have a car ?",
    "content": "I (24F) just got my first car a few months ago. I saved for it for almost 3 years while working full time and taking night classes. It's nothing fancy, an old used Toyota, but it's mince, I bought if myself, and I'm really proud of that. \n\nthe issue is that since I got the car, my family ( mostly my mom and older sister) has started expecting me to drive everyone everywhere. groceries, pharmacy runs, appointments, airport pickups, random errands. Sometimes they as, but more often they just assume I'll do it. I get texts like \"You can take me at 3, right?\" without even checking if I'm available. \n\nMy sister (29f) doesn't work and doesn't drive. She's never really tried, she says driving makes her anxious. Our mom doesn't drive either ( medical reasons ). For the past 10 years, they've relied on public transport, taxis, or friends. but now that I have a car, they act like I'm their personal chauffeur. \n\nI've tried setting boundaries. I've told them I'm happy to help when I can, but i can't always be available, especially since I still work full time and I'm trying to finish my degree. But when I say no, they get super upset. My sister sulks and complains I'm selfish, and my mon says things like, \"We've always helped you when you needed it.\" \n\nLast week, I refused to drive my sister across town for a job interview because I had an exam that evening, She ended up missing it and now blames me for \"ruining her chance.\" Our aunt even called to tell me I should \"sacrifice a little\" because \"family helps family.\" \n\nI feel awful, but also kind of resentful. I bought this car so I could be more independent, not so I could become the default ride for two grown adults who've chosen not to drive. But maybe I'm being too rigid. \n\nAITA for refusing to be the family driver, even through I'm the only one with a car? ",

But the constant expectation of being available as an on-demand taxi service is ridiculous, especially when OP is working AND in school.

First, set up a calendar either on paper or online. Mark off the times you CANNOT AND WILL NOT help them in red. This includes your work schedule every week as well as your class schedule, along with any social engagements and other obligations/travel, etc. Be sure you include travel time/getting ready time in the red blocks.\n\nThen in yellow mark off the times when you MIGHT be available. No guarantees and they still have to get an OK from you before they make plans. But it's OK to ask. If they schedule something in the yellow zone without talking to you first, it's an automatic no unless there's a damn good reason they didn't ask first. \n\nFinally, I'd put a FEW green patches on the calendar, marking times that you can be available to them and for how long. Tell them you expect them to consolidate errands, etc. and plan appointments within the range of these green zones. Have them put where they want to go, and how long they think it will take, in the green areas. Make it clear that you expect them to plan trips to hit multiple goals when possible -- say, drop sis off at the hairdresser, take mom to the pharmacy and Walmart, pick sis up and stop by the grocery store to pick up frozen stuff on the way home. Before you set the \"green\" times, talk to them about when they are most likely to need you, and more importantly, when you are most able to accommodate them.\n\nI know other posters here probably won't like this plan because it gives them some claim to that \"green\" time. But it sounds like you really want to find a way to keep the peace without letting them monopolize your time.... and I'm guessing you don't want to have to move out to accomplish that. This way, they can't claim they you refuse to help them -- not while you're committing to help them during the times you've designated as OK.\n\nAnd one more thing: They need to pay mileage. This is a fixed sum per mile that's meant to cover fuel, upkeep, car payments and insurance. Right now the federal mileage-reiumbursement rates are 70 cents per mile for business travel, 21 cents for medical travel and 17 cents per mile for charitable groups. I'd shoot for something in the middle. This way, their costs are directly related to their usage of your car: there is no \"I got gas last time and you drove to work three times on that tank\" or other hinky math. (Make it clear, however, that if you want to make a personal stop while you're helping them run errands, that does not change the computation of mileage.)",

The mileage reimbursement is brilliant too, I hadn't even thought about the wear and tear costs.\n\nMy only concern is that my family might see the green zones as \"guaranteed ride times\" and get even more entitled about those slots. Like \"but Thursday afternoon is GREEN, you HAVE to take me shopping!\" Maybe I need to be super clear that green just means \"ask me first and I'll probably say yes if I don't have something come up\"?\n\nBut overall this seems way better than my current strategy of just getting frustrated and saying no without any real system.

Sure, make some exceptions for mom when you can but you do have other responsibilities. You can tell your aunt and whomever else (respectfully) to save the guilt trips. Who\u2019s going to pay for maintenance? Who\u2019s going to pay for parts? Who\u2019s going to come out of pocket if and when things break or go bad? Not your sister, since she has no job. They may not like it, but you DO have the right to say no or \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d</p>\n</div>",

The sister had plenty of time to figure out transportation to her interview before the day of, and it's not OP's fault she missed it. Public transport and ride services existed before OP got a car, and they can still use those. Being family doesn't mean you're obligated to be someone's personal chauffeur, especially when you have your own work and school commitments.",

Her sister literally missed a job interview because she couldn't be bothered to plan transportation in advance or learn to drive herself. That's not OP's fault. There's a difference between helping family occasionally and being expected to drop everything to be someone's personal driver.",

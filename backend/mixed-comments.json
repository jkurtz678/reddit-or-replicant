Companies get so caught up in their own bubble that they convince themselves everything they do is brilliant. I've sat through internal presentations that were just as bad, where everyone in the room is nodding along like it's revolutionary when it's complete nonsense. The difference is most companies don't livestream their embarrassing moments to the world.",

Look at how Apple does their product launches - everything is polished, the transitions are smooth, and the presenters are well-rehearsed but still natural. Sure, you lose that 'live demo tension,' but when your product actually works, you don't need that gimmick. OpenAI is trying too hard to prove transparency at the expense of basic presentation quality. Honestly feels like they're copying Elon's awkward Tesla reveals but without the charisma to pull it off.",

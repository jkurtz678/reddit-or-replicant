    "content": "Sounds silly, right? How can one fuck up by just petting their dog?\n\nLet me take you to last month. I was going to have dental surgery so I boarded my dog. This place in particular has fenced in acreage where dogs that are friendly can romp to their hearts content.\n\nWell my dog spent 4 days there and had an absolute blast. He was playing and running around and having fun. He came back damp and covered in slobber, panting like he had the time of his life.\n\nI noticed he was stinky and a bit dirty so I made a mental note to get him washed as I have dog allergies. Well life happened and I forgot to wash him. He's a border collie so most of the stink and nastiness just kinda rolled off him. They have a wash and wear coat.\n\nWell today I was petting my dog absentmindedly as I was watching YouTube. I was sleep deprived while he was letting me pick some of his fluff out. I go to rub my eyes because I'm tired and sick. And within 5 minutes my eyes swell shut and they're runny and weepy.\n\nI didn't connect the dots until after I took an antihistamine and the swelling went down. My dog was running around with labradors. I am allergic to dogs. Usually if I rub my eyes after petting him it's 5 minutes of discomfort and then it subsides. I am very allergic to labradors. Something in the oils that make their coats water-repellant sticks to a lot of stuff and causes me allergic reactions. My dog got slobbered on by labradors.\n\nTl;dr:\nTIFU by petting my dog, forgetting that he was running around with labradors and not washing him. My eyes burned so intensely I couldn't open them fully for 15 minutes until I took an antihistamine. ",

It reminds me of how DeepMind used self-play to master Go and other games, but at a much grander scale. Being able to generate novel training scenarios on demand could help solve one of the biggest bottlenecks in AI development - the need for diverse, high-quality training data. Though I wonder how they're handling the computational requirements, since generating and then training on these simulations must be incredibly resource-intensive even for Google.",

Yes, Google has access to massive datasets, but the real innovation is in how Gemini processes and reasons about that data in novel ways. Entertainment applications might be the most visible right now, but the underlying architectural improvements could have huge implications for scientific research, medical diagnostics, and engineering applications. We shouldn't dismiss technological progress just because some of its early applications seem superficial.",
